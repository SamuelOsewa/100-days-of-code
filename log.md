100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 6: May 15, 2022

Today's Progress: Created two pull requests in the solidity repo with one being for an error message and the other being for the cheat sheet in the documentation.

Thoughts: Okay so today was a like trying to get something done even tho I really didn't want to. I hope I can progress more in solidity in the coming days.
